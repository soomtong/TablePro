  Prepares and ships a new TablePro release — bumps version numbers in
  project.pbxproj, finalizes CHANGELOG.md, commits, tags, and pushes.
  Use this skill whenever the user says "release", "bump version",
  "ship version", "tag a release", "cut a release", or provides a
  version number they want to release (e.g., "/release 0.5.0").

# Release Version

Automate the full release pipeline for TablePro. The user provides the
target version (e.g., `0.5.0`). You handle everything from version bump
through git push.

## Usage

```
/release <version>
```

Example: `/release 0.5.0`

## Pre-flight Checks

Before making any changes, verify ALL of the following. If any check
fails, stop and tell the user what's wrong.

1. **Version argument exists** — the user must provide a semver version
   (e.g., `0.5.0`). If missing, ask for it.

2. **Version is valid semver** — must match `X.Y.Z` where X, Y, Z are
   non-negative integers. Pre-release suffixes like `-beta.1` or `-rc.1`
   are allowed.

3. **Version is newer** — compare against the current `MARKETING_VERSION`
   in `project.pbxproj`. The new version must be greater. Read the
   current value:
   ```
   Grep for "MARKETING_VERSION" in TablePro.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
   ```

4. **Tag doesn't exist** — run `git tag -l "v<version>"` to confirm the
   tag is available.

5. **Working tree is clean** — run `git status --porcelain`. If there are
   uncommitted changes, warn the user and ask whether to proceed (the
   release commit will include those changes).

6. **Unreleased section has content** — read `CHANGELOG.md` and verify
   the `## [Unreleased]` section has entries. If empty, warn the user
   that the release will have no changelog entries.

7. **On main branch** — run `git branch --show-current`. Warn (but don't
   block) if not on `main`.

8. **SwiftLint passes** — run `swiftlint lint --strict`. If there are
   any warnings or errors, spawn a Task subagent to fix all issues
   before continuing with the release. The subagent should run
   `swiftlint --fix` first, then manually fix any remaining issues,
   and verify with `swiftlint lint --strict` until clean.

## Release Steps

### Step 1: Bump Version in project.pbxproj

File: `TablePro.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

There are exactly **4 lines** to update — 2 for `MARKETING_VERSION` and
2 for `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`, all belonging to the **main app target**
(Debug + Release configs).

- Set `MARKETING_VERSION` to the new version (e.g., `0.5.0`)
- Increment `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` by 1 from its current value

**Do NOT touch** the test target's version lines (they have
`MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1`).

To identify the right lines: the main target's versions appear around
lines 380-510 in pbxproj. The test target's are around lines 550-590.
Always read the file and verify context before editing.

Use `replace_all: true` for each edit — the main target's values are
always different from the test target's values (test target has
`MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1`), so
`replace_all` safely targets only the correct occurrences. This is
simpler than editing each of the 4 lines individually.

### Step 2: Finalize CHANGELOG.md

Make these edits to `CHANGELOG.md`:

1. **Convert Unreleased to versioned heading** — replace:
   ```
   ## [Unreleased]
   ```
   with:
   ```
   ## [Unreleased]

   ## [<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>
   ```
   where `<YYYY-MM-DD>` is today's date.

2. **Update footer links** — at the bottom of the file:

   Replace the `[Unreleased]` compare link:
   ```
   [Unreleased]: https://github.com/datlechin/tablepro/compare/v<old-version>...HEAD
   ```
   with:
   ```
   [Unreleased]: https://github.com/datlechin/tablepro/compare/v<version>...HEAD
   [<version>]: https://github.com/datlechin/tablepro/compare/v<old-version>...v<version>
   ```

   `<old-version>` is the previous release version (the one currently in
   the `[Unreleased]` compare link).

### Step 3: Commit (main repo)

Stage the changed files and commit:

```bash
git add TablePro.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Release v<version>
EOF
)"
```

If there were other staged/unstaged changes from the pre-flight check
that the user agreed to include, stage those too.

### Step 4: Tag

```bash
git tag v<version>
```

### Step 5: Push

Push the commit and the tag **separately** — `--follow-tags` only pushes
annotated tags, but `git tag` creates lightweight tags:

```bash
git push origin main && git push origin v<version>
```

This triggers the CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) which
automatically:
- Builds arm64 and x86_64 binaries
- Creates DMG and ZIP artifacts
- Signs with Sparkle EdDSA
- Generates and commits `appcast.xml`
- Creates the GitHub Release with release notes extracted from CHANGELOG.md

### Step 6: Update Documentation Changelogs (separate repo)

The documentation site lives in a **separate git repository** at
`docs/` (relative to project root, mapped to the `tablepro.app` repo).
Two changelog files need a new `<Update>` entry:

- `docs/changelog.mdx` (English)
- `docs/vi/changelog.mdx` (Vietnamese)

**How to write the entry:**

1. Read the new version's section from `CHANGELOG.md` (the entries you
   finalized in Step 2).
2. Rewrite them as a user-friendly `<Update>` block — group entries
   under `### New Features`, `### Improvements`, `### Bug Fixes`, etc.
   (not the raw Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed from Keep a Changelog).
3. Write concise, user-facing descriptions (not developer-internal
   details). Skip purely internal refactors unless they have visible
   impact.

**English format** (`docs/changelog.mdx`):

```mdx
<Update label="<Month Day, Year>" description="v<version>">
  ### New Features

  - **Feature Name**: Description

  ### Improvements

  - Description

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Description
</Update>
```

Insert the new `<Update>` block at the top of the file, right after the
frontmatter `---` closing delimiter (before the first existing `<Update>`).

**Vietnamese format** (`docs/vi/changelog.mdx`):

Same structure but with Vietnamese text. Use the date format
`<Day> tháng <Month>, <Year>` (e.g., `19 tháng 2, 2026`). Translate
feature names and descriptions to Vietnamese. Follow the style of
existing Vietnamese entries in the file.

**Commit and push in the docs repo:**

```bash
cd docs && git add changelog.mdx vi/changelog.mdx && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: update changelog for v<version>
EOF
)" && git push
```

## Post-release Summary

After all pushes, print a summary:

```
Release v<version> (build <build-number>) pushed successfully.

Main repo:
  CI will now build arm64 + x86_64, create DMG/ZIP, update appcast.xml, create GitHub Release.
  Monitor: https://github.com/datlechin/TablePro/actions
  Release: https://github.com/datlechin/TablePro/releases/tag/v<version>

Docs repo:
  Changelog updated and pushed.
```
